## Requirements

*You&rsquo;ll need to have these installed before continuing*

## Quickstart:

- First-time install: use `npm install` to grab all your dependencies. You&rsquo;ll only have to do this once!
- After that, run `grunt` while working on your project to generate CSS, the local server, livereload, and more. 
- Everything should be ready for you to get started!
